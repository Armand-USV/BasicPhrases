# BasicPhrases

Application made on Android Oreo version 8.1 (API 27). There are 8 buttons in this application, each with a suggestive text, and when you press a button you will hear the phrase for example (when you press the button named "Welcome" you will hear "Welcome"). For the audio part I used an object like MediaPlayer, accessing the phrase according to the button tag.
